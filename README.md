# Programmer Calculator

A Python based programmer calculator

## Description

This project was conceived as a flexible programmer calculator primarily for handling binary and hexadecimal values.  I 
wanted to be able to use it without having to think about how it works so the functionality is patterned after the cheap
hardware-based calculators of the good old days.
